2.EC2 with MongoDB
   
3.File store - Amazon S3 Bucket 

4.Networking - VPC, Subnets(private &Public), Security Groups(Access MongoDB instace and S3 ), and NAT Gateway

5.CloudWatch and OpenSearch Service - Amazon Open search -Migrate to the managed OpenSearch Service, which provides managed search and analytics capabilities with better scaling and maintenance.

6.CodePipeline and CodeBuild (or Bitbucket Pipelines if preferred)

7.Secrets Manager

8.WAF and Shield

9.IAM Roles, Policies, and Backups

API Management and External Integrations

•AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Parameter Store: Store and manage secrets such as API keys, database credentials, etc., to securely access third-party services.

•AWS API Gateway: Consider API Gateway to manage external APIs if the backend requires proxying external requests or caching responses.

# Alternatives to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that abstracts infrastructure management, but there are several other options available for deploying your web application:

1. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) / Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with ot without fargate - 
  Amazon ECS: A fully managed container orchestration service for deploying and managing applications in Docker containers. , a serverless compute engine, to handle container scaling and management.
Amazon EKS/GKE/AKS : Managed Kubernetes service for deploying containerized applications. 

2. AWS Lambda (Serverless)
 AWS Lambda allows deploying functions to run without managing servers. For applications with independent functions or microservices, Lambda could replace the need for traditional servers. This works well with API Gateway to handle HTTP requests, though it’s generally best suited for simpler applications or event-driven architecture rather than stateful applications.
3. AWS App Runner
 AWS App Runner is a managed service designed to simplify deploying web applications or APIs from code or containers without worrying about the infrastructure. It automatically handles load balancing, scaling, and HTTPS for a hands-off deployment experience.

4. AWS Lightsail
 AWS Lightsail provides a simplified platform with pre-configured compute, storage, and networking resources, making it a good option for smaller applications needing quick deployment with basic scalability. It’s also well-suited for single-instance applications or early-stage projects.

5. Other Cloud Providers’ PaaS Offerings
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) App Engine: A fully managed platform that supports a wide range of languages and frameworks, with automatic scaling and load balancing.

Microsoft Azure App Service: A managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps with support for multiple languages and frameworks, along with seamless CI/CD integration.

6. Heroku
 Heroku is a popular PaaS for deploying applications without managing infrastructure. It’s easy to set up, supports multiple programming languages, and is particularly well-suited for smaller applications or startups. It integrates well with CI/CD pipelines.

8. Red Hat OpenShift
   
OpenShift is an enterprise-grade Kubernetes platform for containerized applications with features for managing CI/CD, monitoring, and automated scaling. Its  robust Kubernetes-based solution with enhanced security and development features.

Support Multiple Environments for Regional and Test Isolation :- Environment Segregation:-Use AWS Organizations and multiple AWS accounts to separate North America and other regional environments. Each region can have its own account for isolated data and resources, simplifying compliance and data residency requirements.

Test environments, consider creating separate AWS accounts per team or squad or use Elastic Beanstalk or App Runner to create isolated environments per feature branch.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):- Use AWS CFT, Terraform, or AWS CDK to define and automate environment creation, enabling you to quickly replicate environments with consistent configurations. This will make it easier to provision resources for multiple environments across regions.

Data Segregation:•Use Amazon DocumentDB or Amazon DynamoDB with region-specific clusters to keep data isolated per region.
S3 Buckets should be region-specific for storing files, ensuring data complies with residency requirements and limiting cross-region data transfer.

2. Implement Backups for Disaster Recovery :- 
Database Backups:-If using Amazon DocumentDB, enable automated daily backups and point-in-time recovery to ensure data durability.
 MongoDB on EC2, set up automated snapshots for the database and store these in S3. MongoDB, use a multi-AZ setup to ensure high availability and data redundancy.

File Backups:-Enable versioning and lifecycle policies on S3 buckets to retain historical file versions and create regular backups.
Cross-Region Replication on S3 can enhance durability by keeping copies of critical files in multiple regions.
Backup for Configurations and IaC- Store all IaC templates, configurations, and application code in a version-controlled repository (e.g., Bitbucket, GitHub).
Disaster Recovery Testing:-Test the disaster recovery plan regularly by simulating failovers and restoring from backups to ensure the process works as expected.

 Implement a Microservices Architecture - Service Segmentation:•Separate specific functionalities into individual microservices. This will make the system more modular and scalable as each service can evolve independently.

•Use Amazon ECS (Fargate) or AWS Lambda to deploy microservices with auto-scaling, or Amazon EKS for more complex orchestration needs.

•API Gateway: Use AWS API Gateway as a single entry point for external requests to microservices, which improves security and enables rate limiting, authentication, and logging per service.

•Event-Driven Communication:•Use Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS for asynchronous communication between microservices, and AWS EventBridge to orchestrate event-driven processes.

•This allows services to decouple, reducing dependencies and improving fault tolerance

•Centralized Logging and Monitoring:•Use AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring of individual services and AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing to diagnose issues across microservices.

•Amazon OpenSearch Service can aggregate logs from all services, aiding in monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting across the system.

4. Enhance Security and Demonstrate Compliance
   
•Identity and Access Management (IAM):•Use IAM roles and policies to enforce the principle of least privilege, granting each microservice only the permissions necessary for its function.•Use AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce security policies across environments.

•Network Security:•Place all sensitive services in private subnets within a VPC and use Security Groups to control access. Limit public internet exposure through NAT Gateways and restrict direct access to resources like databases.

•For secure data transfer, enable TLS for all external and internal communication between microservices, and AWS WAF to protect against malicious web requests.

•Secrets Management:•Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Parameter Store to securely manage secrets like API keys and database credentials, with fine-grained access control and audit logging.Audit Logging and Compliance:•Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing user and API activity across accounts, and AWS Config to monitor compliance with security policies.Use Shiled for DDoS protection 


Summary of Recommended Changes:

1.Environment Scalability: Use AWS Organizations, isolated VPCs per environment, and IaC for easy environment replication.

2.Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implement automated backups for databases, cross-region replication for critical data, and disaster recovery.

3.Microservices Architecture: Leverage ECS/EKS, API Gateway, and SQS/EventBridge for decoupled, resilient services.

4.Enhanced Security and Compliance: Apply IAM best practices, secure networking, secrets management, and logging for auditability, backed by AWS compliance features to demonstrate security to clients.
